.SH "NAME"
\fBduc\fR \- index, query and graph disk usage
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBduc\fR \fIsubcommand\fR \fIoptions\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Duc is a collection of tools for inspecting and visualizing disk usage\.
.P
Duc maintains an indexed database of accumulated sizes of directories of your file system, and allows you to query this database with some tools, or create fancy sunburst graphs to show you where your bytes are\.
.P
Duc scales quite well, it has been tested on systems with more then 500 million files and several petabytes of storage\.
.SH "USAGE"
Duc comes with a command line tool called \fBduc\fR, which is used to create, maintain and query the disk usage database\. run \fBduc help\fR to get a list of available commands\. \fBduc help <subcommand>\fR describes the usage of a specific subcommand\. Run \fBduc help \-\-all\fR for an extensive list of all commands and their options\.
.P
Some commands might not be available on your system, depending on the exact configuration chosen when building Duc\. (For example, the \fBduc gui\fR command is not available in the \fBduc\-nox\fR package on Debian and Ubuntu)
.P
Duc allows any option to be placed either on the command line or in a configuration file\. Options on the command line are preceded by a double\-leading\-dash (\fB\-\-option\fR), some options have a corresponding short option which can be used as well with a single leading dash\. (\fB\-o\fR)
.P
At startup duc tries to read its configuration from three locations in this particular order: \fB/etc/ducrc\fR, \fB~/\.config/duc/ducrc\fR, \fB~/\.ducrc\fR and \fB\./\.ducrc\fR\.
.P
A configuration file consists of sections and parameters\. The section names correspond to the duc subcommands for which the parameters in that section apply\. A section begins with the name of the section in square brackets and continues until the next section begins\. Sections contain parameters, one per line, which consist of a single option name for boolean flags, or an option name and a value for options which take a value\. See the EXAMPLES section for an example of the configuration file format\.
.SH "CREATING THE INDEX"
Duc needs an index file of the file system before it is able to show any information\. To create the index, run the \fBduc index\fR command\. For example, to create an index of your home directory run \fBduc index ~\fR
.IP "" 4
.nf
$ duc index /usr
Skipping lost+found: Permission denied
Indexed 333823 files and 48200 directories, (35\.0GB total) in 1 seconds
.fi
.IP "" 0
.P
The default location of the database is \fB$HOME/\.duc\.db\fR\. To use a different database location, use the DUC_DATABASE environment variable or specify the database location with the \-\-database argument\.
.P
You can run \fBduc index\fR at any time later to rebuild the index\.
.P
By default Duc indexes all directories it encounters during file system traversal, including special file systems like /proc and /sys, and network file systems like NFS or Samba mounts\. There are a few options to select what parts of your filesystem you want to include or exclude from the scan, check the documentation below for the options \-\-one\-file\-system, \-\-exclude, \-\-fs\-exclude and \-\-fs\-include for more details\.
.SH "QUERYING THE INDEX"
Duc has various subcommands for querying or exploring the index: (Note that depending on your configuration, some of these commands might not be available)
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBduc info\fR shows a list of available directory trees in the database, and the time and date of the last scan\.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBduc ls\fR lists all files and directories under the given path on the console\.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBduc ui\fR runs a ncurses based console user interface for exploring the file system usage\.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBduc gui\fR starts a graphical (X11) interface representing the file system in a sunburst graph\. Click on a directory to redraw the graph from the perspective of the selected directory\. Click in the center of the graph to go up one directory in the tree\.
.IP "" 0

.SH "CGI INTERFACING"
The \fBduc\fR binary has support for a rudimentary CGI interface, currently only tested with apache\. The CGI interface generates a simple HTML page with a list of indexed directories, and shows a clickable graph for navigating the file system\. If the option \fB\-\-list\fR is given, a list of top sized files/dirs is also written\.
.P
Configuration is done by creating a simple shell script as \.cgi in a directory which is configured for CGI execution by your web server (usually \fB/usr/lib/cgi\-bin\fR)\. The shell script should simply start duc, and pass the location of the database to navigate\.
.P
An example duc\.cgi script would be
.IP "" 4
.nf
#!/bin/sh
/usr/local/bin/duc cgi \-d /home/jenny/\.duc\.db
.fi
.IP "" 0
.IP "\[ci]" 4
Make sure the database file is readable by the user (usually www\-data)
.IP "\[ci]" 4
Debugging is best done by inspecting the web server's error log
.IP "\[ci]" 4
Make sure the \.cgi script has execute permissions (\fBchmod +x duc\.cgi\fR)
.IP "" 0
.P
Some notes:
.IP "\[ci]" 4
The HTML page is generated with a simple embedded CSS style sheet\. If the style is not to your liking you can provide an external CSS url with the \-\-css\-url option which will then be used instead of the embedded style definition\.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
Add the option \-\-list to generate a table of top sized files and directories in the HTML page\.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
The options \-\-header and \-\-footer allow you to insert your own HTML code before and after the main\.
.IP "" 0
.P
The current CGI configuration is not very flexible, nor secure\. It is not advised to run the CGI from public reachable web servers, use at your own risk\.
.SH "A NOTE ON FILE SIZE AND DISK USAGE"
The concepts of 'file size' and 'disk usage' can be a bit confusing\. Files on disk have an apparent size, which indicates how much bytes are in the file from the users point of view; this is the size reported by tools like \fBls \-l\fR\. The apparent size can be any number, from 0 bytes up to several TB\. The actual number of bytes which are used on the filesystem to store the file can differ from this apparent size for a number of reasons: disks store data in blocks, which cause files to always take up a multiple of the block size, files can have holes ('sparse' files), and other technical reasons\. This number is always a multiple of 512, which means that the actual size used for a file is almost always a bit more then its apparent size\.
.P
Duc has two modes for counting file sizes:
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBapparent size\fR: this is the size as reported by \fBls\fR\. This number indicates the file length, which is usually smaller then the actual disk usage\.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBactual size\fR: this is the size as reported by \fBdu\fR and \fBdf\fR\. The actual file size tells you how much disk is actually used by a file, and is always a multiple of 512 bytes\.
.IP "" 0
.P
The default mode used by duc is to use the 'actual size'\. Most duc commands to report disk usage (\fBduc ls\fR, \fBduc graph\fR, \fBduc ui\fR, etc) have an option to change between these two modes (usually the \fB\-a\fR), or use the 'a' key to toggle\.
.SH "BUILDING from git"
If you use git clone to pull down the latest release, you will have to do the following:
.P

.SH "FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS"
.IP "\[ci]" 4
What does the error 'Database version mismatch mean?'
.IP
The layout of the index database sometimes changes when new features are implemented\. When you get this error you have probably upgraded to a newer version\. Just remove the old database file and rebuild the index\.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
Duc crashes with a segmentation fault, is it that buggy?
.IP
By default Duc uses the Tokyocabinet database backend\. Tokyocabinet is pretty fast, stores the database in a single file and has nice compression support to keep the database small\. Unfortunately, it is not always robust and sometimes chokes on corrupt database files\. Try to remove the database and rebuild the index\. If the error persists contact the authors\.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
Some of the Duc subcommands like \fBduc gui\fR are not available on my system?
.IP
Depending on the configuration that was chosen when building Duc, some options might or might not be available in the \fBduc\fR utility\. For example, on Debian or Ubuntu Duc comes in two flavours: there is a full featured package called \fBduc\fR, or a package without dependencies on X\-windows called \fBduc\-nox\fR, for which the latter lacks the \fBduc gui\fR command\.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBduc index\fR is hogging my system and using a lot of CPU and I/O!
.IP
Traversing a file system is hard work \- which is the exact reason why Duc exists in the first place\. You can use the default tools to make Duc behave nice towards other processes on your machine, use something like:
.IP
\fBnice 19 ionice \-c 3 duc index [options]\fR
.IP
This makes \fBduc index\fR run with the lowest CPU and I/O scheduler priorities, which is nicer to all the other processes on your machine\.

Duc mainains an index of scanned directories, which defaults to ~/\.duc\.db\. All tools take the \-d/\-\-database option to override the database path\.
